        The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both Async/await and Promises are techniques used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations. Promises were introduced in ES6 as a cleaner and more readable way of handling asynchronous code. Async/await is a newer syntax that builds upon Promises to make asynchronous code even easier to write and read
    </p>
    <p>
        A Promise is in one of these states: <br>

        <b>pending</b>: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. <br>
        <b>fulfilled</b>: meaning that the operation was completed successfully. <br>
        <b>rejected</b>: meaning that the operation failed. <br>
    </p>
