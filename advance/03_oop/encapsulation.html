    <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
    <p>Encapsulation is the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object’s components, usually by making attributes private or protected.</p>
    <p><b>Purpose:</b><br> To protect the internal state of an object and ensure it is used only in controlled ways.</p>
    <p><b>How It’s Achieved:</b> <br> Through access modifiers like private, protected, and public (though JavaScript lacks true privacy, other languages like Java and Python support this more explicitly).</p>
    <p><b>Example:</b> <br> A BankAccount class may hide its balance and only allow it to be accessed or modified through methods like deposit() and withdraw(), preventing unauthorized access.    </p>
    <p class="code">
        class BankAccount {
            #balance = 0; // private field (using # syntax for private in JavaScript)
        
            deposit(amount) {
                if (amount > 0) this.#balance += amount;
            }
        
            withdraw(amount) {
                if (amount > 0 && amount <= this.#balance) this.#balance -= amount;
            }
        
            getBalance() {
                return this.#balance;
            }
        }
        
        const account = new BankAccount();
        account.deposit(100);
        console.log(account.getBalance());
    </p>
    <p>Here, the balance is kept private (#balance), and the only way to change or access it is through the deposit, withdraw, and getBalance methods.</p>
